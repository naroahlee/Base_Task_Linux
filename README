Calibration Stage 1
To Determine How many ticks do we have for a CLOCK_REALTIME 1s

Method:
	1. Ensure we only have one full budget VCPU for the VM
	2. Ensure this VCPU is pinned to a dedicated PCPU
	3. using calib_stage1_exp.sh to generate Tracing File.
	4. using stats_stage1_exp.sh to get the curve
	5. Change all the MHZ KHZ HZ parameters in tracing.h

Calibration Stage 2
To Determine the Qcnt ==> Wcet Mapping
So that we can find the inverse fxn for Wcet ==> Qcnt

Method:
	0. Determine how many times shall we do sqrt() for consuming 100us
	1. Ensure we only have one full budget VCPU for the VM
	2. Ensure this VCPU is pinned to a dedicated PCPU
	3. using calib_stage2_exp.sh to generate Tracing File.
	4. using stats_stage2_exp.sh to get the curve
